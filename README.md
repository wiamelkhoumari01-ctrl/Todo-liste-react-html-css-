This project is a Todo List application developed using React with HTML and CSS. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks through a simple and intuitive interface. The application includes a light mode and dark mode system that improves user experience by allowing theme switching according to user preference. The main objective of this project is to practice core React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, handling user interactions, and conditional rendering. It also focuses on building a clean, responsive, and well-structured front-end interface while following professional development practices. The project is developed in an academic learning context for the academic year 2025–2026.
